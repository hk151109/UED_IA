## Accessibility, Usability & Inclusivity Implementation Report

This report documents the implementation of accessibility and inclusivity principles as part of the User Experience Design Internal Assessment 2. The project follows the prescribed methodology of identifying accessibility issues, analyzing user challenges, providing recommendations, and developing a working prototype.



### 1. Selection of Application
**Application Selected**: Somaiya Vidyavihar Library Online Catalogue
- **Rationale**: The existing library website lacked modern accessibility and inclusivity principles
- **User Base**: Students, faculty, researchers, and general public with diverse abilities and device preferences
- **Daily Usage**: Academic research, book borrowing, information access

### 2. Challenges Faced by Different User Groups

#### Visual Impairments
- **Screen Reader Users**: Lack of ARIA labels, semantic HTML, and proper heading structure
- **Low Vision Users**: Insufficient color contrast, non-resizable text, lack of high contrast mode
- **Color Blind Users**: Poor color differentiation, reliance on color-only information

#### Motor Disabilities
- **Keyboard-only Users**: Missing focus indicators, non-keyboard accessible controls
- **Limited Dexterity**: Small touch targets, complex multi-step interactions
- **Motor Control Issues**: Lack of sufficient time for interactions, motion sensitivity

#### Cognitive Disabilities
- **Navigation Complexity**: Confusing menu structures, lack of clear visual hierarchy
- **Information Overload**: Dense content without clear organization
- **Memory Issues**: No persistent user preferences, inconsistent interface patterns

#### Mobile/Situational Impairments
- **Mobile Users**: Fixed desktop layout, non-responsive design
